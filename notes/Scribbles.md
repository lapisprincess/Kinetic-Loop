I have all these questions about where I should put what. I'm starting to think I should have a separate Graphic class outside of the Board class which handles pulling and managing graphics. It would be a class which other methods would include in their instances, since everything so far has had graphics with repeating methods etc. I could just initialize a Graphic object as the image, since it should inherent pg.Surface. I just wanna add specific methods to pull tiles from the tileset. This way, I won't have to do all the tile graphic management over and over again for every parent class. Plus I could keep a consistent tileset between everything by having a constant in the graphic class determining the filepath.
I'm also wondering if I should have a Coord object as well. Having that would make movement a more universally implementable feature, rather than having to define it for every individual class. 
So maybe before I continue doing things, I should design those two classes and try implementing them into my existing classes. I'll start with Graphic and see where I go from there.
