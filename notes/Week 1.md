### What I learned/decided over break
- PyGame is probably best option
	- Distribution will be an important factor to research
- Found open source 16x16 tileset to use
- Designed outline for GDD

### Plans for this week
- [x] Create basic tile objects
- [x] Create entities
- [x] Render both onto screen
- [x] Allow for interactions between tiles (entities bumping into walls)
- [x] Create player character (make movable)
- [x] Mess around with directionality

### Goals for next week
* [ ] Have code to create specific entities
	* [ ] NPCs
	* [ ] Enemies
* [ ] Build dungeon layouts (randomized?)
* [ ] Research roguelike randomization
